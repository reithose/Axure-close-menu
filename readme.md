Script to collapse the page tree in the navigation menu in Axure HTML exports on page load. Helpful for large Axure exports. Tested in Axure 8 and 9.


Add this script as a plugin on [app.axure.cloud](https://app.axure.cloud) or in index.html in your local export. Add only to the frontpage to close the menu on load. Otherwise the menu closes while navigating through your model which is annoying.
